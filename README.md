<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

FANTASIA is a collection of tools for UE4 that I have developed over the years to work with Embodied Conversational Agents at the university of padua and at the university of naples Federico II in Italy. Since I have been working with different characters for different tasks, I developed these tools so that the functionalities characterising one agent could be easily trasferred to others. Since I have done this multiple times with minimal effort, now, and since there appears to be an increasing interest towards Virtual Humans in UE4, I decided to take all the dirty code I have and re-enginner it so that I could distribute it to the community. I hope it will be helpful for other colleagues in the academy but I also hope it will help someone else produce amazing stuff.
